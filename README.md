CivUpload
=========

ZF2 module for file upload and browse.

Designed to provide a back end for CKEditor for uploading image files to server and browsing and selecting existing
image files on the server. Works with the CivContent module.

The plan is to extend this to include bulk image upload via zip file, which will extract image files from the zip,
save them on the server and index them in a mySQL database. This will then integrate with the CivGallery module.
(or maybe CivUpload will become CivGallery)
